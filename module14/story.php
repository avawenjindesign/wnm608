            STORY
        </h1>
        <div style="padding-left: 700px;">
            <p>The idea for Design Within Reach came to founder Rob  </p>
            <p>Forbes in 1998, when he tried to furnish his apartment </p>
            <p>with the clean, simple classics he’d come to appreciate </p>
            
        </div>
    <div>
           while living in London. He discovered that works by designers such as the Eameses, Le Corbusier and Saarinen were and Saarinen were “out of reach”</p>
         <p>for anyone who didn’t know the secret handshake or have the patience to wait months for delivery.
            
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Realizing there had to be a better way, Rob and a small team bought 20 containers of inventory, mailed a catalog and waited for the phone to ring. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Architects, interior designers, and the general public responded immediately, and to our surprise, so did the brands that Rob had struggled to </p>
        <p> get his hands on just months earlier. One of the first brands to appreciate our approach was the Michigan-based company Herman Miller. Within</p>
        <p>a year of launching, we were bringing the Eames Lounge Chair, Aeron Chair, and many other Herman Miller favorites directly to retail customers</p>
        <p> across the country via catalog – for the first time ever. So it was kismet when Design Within Reach became part of the Herman Miller family in 2015.</p>
